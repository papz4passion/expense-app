# Unit Tests for Phase 1

This document summarizes the unit tests created for Phase 1 of the expense tracking app.

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is measured for the entire codebase. To generate a coverage report:

1. Run the script: `./coverage_report.sh`
2. View the HTML report in `coverage/html/index.html`
3. The raw coverage data is available in `coverage/lcov.info`

## Model Tests

### Category Tests (`test/models/category_test.dart`)
- ✅ Category creation
- ✅ toMap conversion
- ✅ fromMap creation
- ✅ copyWith updates
- ✅ Equality based on ID
- ✅ Default categories generation

### Transaction Tests (`test/models/transaction_test.dart`)
- ✅ Transaction creation
- ✅ toMap conversion
- ✅ fromMap creation
- ✅ Invalid transaction type handling
- ✅ copyWith updates
- ✅ Equality based on ID
- ✅ String representation

## Mock Database Tests

### Mock Database Helper (`test/mocks/mock_database_test.dart`)
- ✅ Default categories initialization
- ✅ Transaction insertion and retrieval
- ✅ Transaction update
- ✅ Transaction filtering
- ✅ Balance calculation

### Web Storage Mock (`test/database/web_storage_test.dart`)
- ✅ Initialization
- ✅ Default categories
- ✅ Transaction CRUD operations



## Widget Tests (Need Improvement)

These tests need to be updated to properly handle database initialization:

- ❌ Main app build
- ❌ Navigation
- ❌ Dashboard display

## Known Issues

1. **Database helper test conflict**: The `Transaction` class from our app conflicts with the `Transaction` class from sqflite. Need to use prefixes or different import method.

2. **Widget tests initialization**: The widget tests are failing because database initialization requires special handling in the test environment. The following initialization code needs to be added before the widget tests:

```dart
setUpAll(() {
  sqfliteFfiInit();
  databaseFactory = databaseFactoryFfi;
});
```

## Test Coverage

- The model classes have 100% test coverage
- Database operations are tested through mocks
- UI tests need improvement

## Next Steps

1. Fix database helper test with proper import prefixes
2. Add mock database initialization for widget tests
3. Add more integration tests for key user flows in Phase 2
4. Implement provider state tests
